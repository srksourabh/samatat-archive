## 2. About Page

### Company History (3 Paragraphs)

#### Warm / Evocative
> It started with a spark—a small group of dreamers in 1998, gathered in a cramped rehearsal room, fueled by nothing but tea and a shared passion for the stage. We didn't have much, but we had stories to tell. Over the last 26 years, that spark has grown into a roaring fire. We've weathered storms, celebrated standing ovations, and built a family that extends far beyond the curtain call.
>
> From our humble beginnings to national festivals, Samatat Theatre has always been about more than just acting; it's about connection. We believe that every play is a conversation with our audience, a chance to reflect on who we are and who we might become. Our journey is paved with the laughter, tears, and applause of thousands who have walked through our doors.
>
> Today, we stand on the shoulders of every actor, technician, and volunteer who gave their time to this art. As we look to the future, we carry our history with us—not just in archives, but in the spirit of every new production. The lights are on, the stage is set, and our story continues.

#### Formal / Grant-Ready

Over nearly three decades, the organization has produced over {{total_productions}} major works, ranging from classical adaptations to contemporary experimental theatre, consistently earning critical acclaim and community support.
>

>
> Entering its 27th year, Samatat Theatre remains steadfast in its objective to document and disseminate cultural history.
